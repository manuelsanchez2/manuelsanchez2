Hi, I'm Manuel—a junior web developer based in Hamburg who loves coding with React.js. I have some previous experience regarding digital tools and I am in charge of a very cool project called Doiche Living, which is a travel blog who helps Spanish-speaking population to organize a trip to Germany. My best project is the Doiche Living App, created by using React.js, Node.js and MongoDB, among many other things.
